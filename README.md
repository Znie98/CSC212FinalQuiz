Abstract:
	
	This program is designed to teach people a variety of vocabulary for different tests, including the SAT/ACT, TOEFL/IELTS, GRE, GMAT. 
The user can choose which set of vocabulary to learn and how many words they would like to learn this time. 
(They can also choose if they want to learn in order or randomly. Or choose from small lists)
The Learning Process: 
	A word will be presented on the screen and the user will be prompted to answer if they know the word’s meaning or not. 
Regardless of their response, the meaning of the word will be printed on the screen. 
If the user indicated they don’t know the word, the word will be stored in memory as a new word. Otherwise, the word will be classified as a known word. 


The Review Process:
After learning 5 new words, the user will be asked if they would like to review what they’ve learned so far or continue learning. 
If they choose to review, all new words will be randomly selected and printed on screen. The user needs to enter if they know the meaning of the word. 
If the user indicates they know the word, the meaning of the word will be printed on the screen and automatically be stored as known. 

*(But the user can also choose to classify the word as new if they still don’t feel like they fully understand it.)
If the user indicates they don’t know the word, it will remain as new and reviewed again.
